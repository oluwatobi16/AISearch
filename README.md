# AISearch
Wrote four AI search algorithms to solve the TSP problem, A hill climbing search algorithm and a Genetic algorithm, then advanced implementations of each one. The input is a City file with distances between cities in a distance matrix and the output is a list of all cities i.e a complete tour.
